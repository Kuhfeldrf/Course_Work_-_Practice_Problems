    "# Part 1: Implementing Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a nearly-complete LogisticRegressor, and a simple training set of tumor data, demonstrate your ability to implement a logistic regression model's `fit` function, such that it properly trains its model using gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The LogisticRegressor\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first review the LogisticRegressor, which you should find familiar. Notice that the `fit` method uses a fixed number of iterations, only for simplicity and experimentation, and is stubbed to do nothing. But, also notice that the comments in `fit` describe a training process using gradient descent.\n",

After creating the “delta_w” variable as an implementation of the cost function of the weights, I applied the same technique to establish the “delta_b” variable. After this I knew the next step was to update each value of the weight vector accounting for the learning rate, finally I updated the bias incorporating the learning rate and prior “delta_b” variable.**"

Your goal is to narrate and improve an experiment that measures the performance of the [scikit-learn LogisticRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) model for classifying images of fashion items. We'll use the popular [Fashion MNIST data set](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) by Xiao, Rasul, and Vollgraf. Take a moment now to [familiarize yourself with the version of this data set](), and also take a look at [a version of this data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike prior notebooks, in which you are given either a guided framework of steps, or provided explicit code to try, in this notebook the code shall be your framework. Your goal is to break apart this one big code cell into a cohesive, multi-section, narrated Notebook, that guides the reader through the machine learning process. You have seen and practiced this in prior Notebooks, and you are encouraged to replicate the spirit of our past work here.\n",

    "3. Experiment, tune the model, and discuss your results\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Notebook should consist of many sections, with each section representing a step in the machine learning process. The first section, **Problem Statement**, has been completed for you. Each section should start with a markdown cell containing a descriptive second-level header, and at least a few sentences that prepare the reader for what the purpose of the step is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section should consist of both prose, in markdown cells, and code cells. Almost every section should consist of multiple markdown and code cells. You should often add to the provided code. For example, if you have a section on exploring data, you should probably do more than just look at the `head` and `shape`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first step is to run the code block, and spend time with each line of code to discern how it reflects some unit of work in our machine learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, demonstrate how you modify the experiment and/or tune the model to increase the accuracy of the model. (Spend time with the [official documentation of the data set](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). What is the human accuracy score? Can your model surpass it when validated with the complete training set?)\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we demonstrated the machine learning process by implementing a linear regression model to classify clothing articles based on it image data. Every step of the process was implemented and documented and we saw that with the training and test data we could achieve an initial accuracy of 75%. With hyper parameterization of maximum number of iterations we were able to improve this accuracy to 85%. The max iteration of 100 was found to be the best tuning of the hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The now tune linear regression model was applied to a real world fashion test training set of different images and their associated labels. However optimize model was able to successfully classify the images in this real-world training set had an accuracy of 85%. This accuracy is equivalent to the training set and demonstrates the success of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "When examining the performance of our model compared to results in GitHub we can see it is comparable to what other people are achieving for example most GitHub users post an accuracy range of the mid 0.80s to a max of 0.997 (impressive! And suspicious). A human labeling accuracy was 0.835. Given that many of these GitHub users are probably much more experienced I am pleased with the result of the accuracy of the linear regression model and impressed with this ability to perform on par if not better than humans at image classification.\n"
