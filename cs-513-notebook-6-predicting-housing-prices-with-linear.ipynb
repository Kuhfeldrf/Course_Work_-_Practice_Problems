When complete, you should see the model produce price predictions that begin to approach a \"best fit\" for the simple training data above (note: there are particular reasons why the fit will not be as 'perfect' as our univariate example). Here are some suggestions for completing your implementation.\n\n1. Modify the existing MultipleLinearRegressor class definition above.\n2. Run your code frequently, using _Run All_ and running the code in the \"Test Run\" code cell above.\n2. Draw inspiration from the UnivariateLinearRegressor - the structure of gradient descent remains the same, we just need to handle a vector of weights and features.\n3. Consider replicating the small steps taken in the exploration. Start with `fit`.\n4. Review the Exploration content and familiarize yourself with the expressions for computing the partial derivatives with respect to `w` and `b` when using a _vector_ of weights and features.\n5. Implement just _one_ of the partial derivative functions first, and verify that the prediction output has changed.\n6. For convenience, you can create a new code cell with the class definition, data, instantiation and usage all in one code cell if you wish. But when complete, please be sure that you remove it, and that the MultipleLinearRegressor class definition above is complete.\n\nThe best tip for thinking about this challenge is to become intimately familiar with the expressions for computing the gradients, or partial derivatives, for w and b. Then, try first working out on paper how your implementation of these computations might work, given the vector of weights and features.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 💡 Conclusion\n**The first thing did was to examine the universal function and replace missing pieces of code in the multiple linear function. Then I tried replacing the cost function methods to independently return 0 which indicated the weight parameters were crucial whereas basis could remain at zero and produce results. Manually decreasing input weights was seen to decrease predicted outputs, however these weights are optimized by the gradient descent function and are not a hyper parameter. The next parameter to tweak was alpha. When alpha was 0.1 the predict values were ~-1e-50 lowering alpha progressively increased the accuracy of the prediction rate. A sweet spot for alpha was found at 0.0000001 which results in an average of 96% accuracy. Then I increased the number of steps from 10 to 13 which increased average accuracy to 100%**\n\n**Both functions use gradient descent to iteratively find weights and basis where the minimal cost function is at its minimum. However with multiple variables you have a more complex model and a vector of weights to adjust compared to a single weight with a univariate function. This resulted in the alpha (learning rate) or step size having to be significantly different in order to find the optimized cost function given the multiple variables. Where as the univariant model has only one weight associated with the learning rate.  In addition the univariant model could simply multiply the single weight by the feature where as the multivariant model would have to use a dot.product to handle to vector of weights and features.**\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Part 2: Predicting California Housing Prices\n\n_Attribution: Special thanks to Dr. Roi Yehoshua_\n\nIn this, the second, part of this notebook, you will construct a guided experiment to analyze the quality of a linear regression model for predicting real housing prices.

The attributes are:\nlongitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west\nlatitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north\nhousingMedianAge: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building\ntotalRooms: Total number of rooms within a block\ntotalBedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block\npopulation: Total number of people residing within a block\nhouseholds: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block\nmedianIncome: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)\nmedianHouseValue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)\noceanProximity: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea**\n\n**All are floats except ocean_proximiaty**\n\n**The only attribute with missing values is total_bedrooms which has 207 missing data points. All associated rows with missing data will be dropped prior to train/test split**\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that our data set is loaded, let's explore what we

model, we would like to standardize the training set. To do this, we'll use the sklearn StandardScaler. Once we standardize the data, we will use it to train a linear regression model. In our case, we will experiment with the scikit-learn [SGDRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html), a linear regression model that trains via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Please be sure to take a look at [the documentation for SGDRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html).\n\nTo demonstrate a new feature in scikit-learn, and to give you some new ideas in your own future work, we will illustrate a small \"machine learning pipeline,\" using the scikit-learn [Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) class.\n\nA Pipeline is handy for \"setting up\" multiple pre-processing steps that will run one after the other. The Pipeline can also end in a training step with a model. This enables us to provide the Pipeline our training data, and with one method call, complete both pre-processing and training in one step.\n\nWe'll import the necessary libraries, create our Pipeline, fill it with a StandardScalar and SGDRegressor, and run the Pipeline.\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\npipeline = Pipeline([\n    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n    ('regressor', SGDRegressor())\n])\n```\n\nTry importing the necessary libraries and building your Pipeline below.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\npipeline = Pipeline([\n    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n    ('regressor', SGDRegressor())\n])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-17T19:24:34.797015Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-17T19:24:34.797449Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-17T19:24:34.803950Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-17T19:24:34.797414Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-17T19:24:34.802641Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":114,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With our Pipeline created, we can now invoke the Pipeline's `fit` method, passing it the training data.

This was done through looping over parameters of the Regressor such as  penalty, alpha, max_iter, random_state, learning_rate, loss, and average but no meaningful improvement of R^2 > 0.64 could be achieved.

The ability to import pre-bult complex functions that are optimized is such a time saver. Secondly, I’m impressed at how well the default settings of the SGDRegressor performed.  In addition, I’m surprised the housing attributes did a good job (moderate R^2) at predicting price since it seems like something like housing price, like most of economics is irrational. I guess irrational things can be correlated…**\n\n**An attempt was made to optimize the performance of the model and increase the R^2.

I wonder how much R^2 would change if the dataset was taken say 1/2020 to now, where there have been crazy swings in economic conditions, likely decreasing correlation. Also, I would be interested to see if the least square method for finding a relationship between housing attributes and price would be just as accurate, and if the simpler approach might result in better data. Or if reducing the features of the dataset could improve correlations. Overall, this model did do a good job at explaining the relationship in the data and I look forward to applying it to other problems**\n","metadata":{}}]}
